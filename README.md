As a prerequisite, you need to have Python3, venv, and Jupyter Lab installed on your machine

1. To run the code, you need first to download sentinel2 images and place the unzipped folders in the folder ./sentinel2-imgs
2. On terminal, run the following command from the folder where you downloaded the code:
`source ./jupyter-from-venv.sh`
3. The command above will install all packages you need and start a jupyter lab session
4. You can now run the code in the notebook `main.ipynb`
